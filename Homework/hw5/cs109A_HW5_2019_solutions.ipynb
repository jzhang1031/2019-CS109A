    "For the full logistic regression model, there are 12 false positives and 21 false negatives, and for the LASSO-like logistic regression model, there are 10 false positives and 11 false negatives, and knn-7 has one more false negative compared to LASSO.  The full logistic regression model has a tougher time predicting what are truly 'positives' here, but actually underperforms in both classes compared to the other two models considered."
